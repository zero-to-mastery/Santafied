- Text/Copy
- Documentation
- Fix Typos, Code Bugs or Accessibility oversights
 
## Project Brief
Over the years Santa Claus has noticed a decline in the Christmas spirit and is in desperate need of our help! Santa and his elf have put together a [basic design concept](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Santafied/tree/master/design) for a brand new website they want to be able to launch in November.
 
The website should provide visitors with the following:
- [ ] A page for Christmas information and facts.
- [ ] Recipes page for traditional food and drinks at Christmas
- [ ] Gift suggestions for secret santas
- [ ] Lyrics for Christmas songs
- [ ] Christmas games
- [ ] Christmas Films
- [ ] Christmas Books
- [ ] Christmas Activities
- [ ] Christmas themed party costumes
- [ ] Christmas themed backgrounds
- [ ] Christmas themed [name generator](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+my+christmas+name&oq=what+is+my+christma&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.8031j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
