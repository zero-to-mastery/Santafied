![Santafied](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/598312632407293963/626070022447431783/santafied.png)

Welcome to this year's HTML challenge for Hacktoberfest ([What is Hacktoberfest?](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/hacktoberfest-2019#what-is-hacktoberfest)). A project with beginners and aspiring developers in mind, utilizing HTML, CSS & maybe a dash of JavaScript to achieve a simplistic yet elegant Christmas themed website.

Everyone is encouraged to participate, regardless of your skill level. This is a practice project and should be considered a playground. This project has plenty of options for collaboration, here are just a few of the many that we welcome pull requests:

- HTML elements
- CSS styling
- Images
- Text/Copy
- Documentation
- Fix Typos, Code Bugs or Accessibility oversights

## Project Brief

Over the years Santa Claus has noticed a decline in the Christmas spirit and is in desperate need of our help! Santa and his elves have put together a [basic design concept](https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Santafied/tree/master/design) for a brand new website they want to be able to launch in November.

The website should provide visitors with the following:

- [ ] A page for Christmas information and facts.
- [ ] Recipes page for traditional food and drinks of Christmas
- [ ] Gift suggestions for secret santas
- [ ] Lyrics for Christmas songs :musical_note:
- [ ] Christmas games 🎮
- [ ] Christmas Films 🎥
- [ ] Christmas Books 📚
- [ ] Christmas Activities 🤪
- [ ] Christmas themed party costumes 👻
- [ ] Christmas themed backgrounds 🗻
- [ ] Christmas themed [name generator webapp](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+my+christmas+name&oq=what+is+my+christma&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.8031j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) 📱
