                      [Chorus]<br>
                      Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>
                      But the very next day you gave it away<br>
                      This year, to save me from tears<br>
                      I'll give it to someone special<br>
                      Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>
                      But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)<br>
                      This year, to save me from tears<br>
                      I'll give it to someone special (Special)<br>
                      <br>
                      [Verse 1]<br>
                      Once bitten and twice shy<br>
                      I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye<br>
                      Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?<br>
                      Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me<br>
                      <br>
                      [Verse 2]<br>
                      (Happy Christmas) I wrapped it up and sent it<br>
                      With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it<br>
                      Now I know what a fool I've been<br>
                      But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again<br>
                      <br>
                      [Chorus]<br>
                      Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>
                      But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)<br>
                      This year, to save me from tears<br>
                      I'll give it to someone special (Special)<br>
                      Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>
                      But the very next day you gave it away<br>
                      This year, to save me from tears<br>
                      I'll give it to someone special (Special, oh)<br>
                      Oh, oh, baby<br>
                      <br>
                      [Verse 3]<br>
                      A crowded room, friends with tired eyes<br>
                      I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice<br>
                      My God, I thought you were someone to rely on<br>
                      Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on<br>
                      <br>
                      [Verse 4]<br>
                      A face on a lover with a fire in his heart<br>
                      A man under cover but you tore me apart<br>
                      Ooh-hoo<br>
                      Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again<br>
                      <br>
                      [Chorus]<br>
                      Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>
                      But the very next day you gave it away (You gave it away)<br>
                      This year, to save me from tears<br>
                      I'll give it to someone special (Special)<br>
                      Last Christmas, I gave you my heart (I gave you my heart)<br>
                      But the very next day you gave it away (You gave me away)<br>
                      This year, to save me from tears (Ohh)<br>
                      I'll give it to someone special (Special)<br>
                      <br>
                      [Outro]<br>
                      A face on a lover with a fire in his heart (I gave you my heart)<br>
                      A man under cover but you tore him apart<br>
                      Maybe next year<br>
                      I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special<br>
                      Special...<br>

                      All I Want for Christmas Is You" is a Christmas song performed by American singer and songwriter
                      Mariah Carey. She wrote and produced the song alongside Walter Afanasieff. Columbia Records
                      released it on November 28, 1994,[1] as the lead single from her fourth studio album and first
                      holiday album, Merry Christmas (1994). The track is an uptempo love song that includes bell
                      chimes, heavy back-up vocals, and synthesizers. It is also the best-selling modern day Christmas
                      song making her the "Queen of Christmas" in popular culture and music.

                      I-I-I don't want a lot for Christmas<br>
                      There is just one thing I need<br>
                      I don't care about the presents<br>
                      Underneath the Christmas tree<br>
                      I just want you for my own<br>
                      More than you could ever know<br>
                      Make my wish come true<br>
                      All I want for Christmas is you, yeah<br>
                      <br>
                      [Verse 1]<br>
                      I don't want a lot for Christmas<br>
                      There is just one thing I need (And I)<br>
                      Don't care about the presents<br>
                      Underneath the Christmas tree<br>
                      I don't need to hang my stocking<br>
                      There upon the fireplace (I)<br>
                      Santa Claus won't make me happy<br>
                      With a toy on Christmas Day<br>

                      [Chorus]<br>
                      I just want you for my own (ooh, ooh, ooh)<br>
                      More than you could ever know (oh, oh, oh)<br>
                      Make my wish come true<br>

                      [Verse 2]<br>
                      Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas<br>
                      I won't even wish for snow (And I)<br>
                      I'm just going to keep on waiting<br>
                      Underneath the mistletoe<br>
                      I won't make a list and send it<br>
                      To the North Pole for Saint Nick (I)<br>
                      I won't even stay awake to<br>
                      Hear those magic reindeer click<br>

                      What more can I do?<br>
                      Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you<br>

                      This is all I'm asking for (Ah)<br>
                      I just want to see my baby<br>

                        [Run]<br>
                        It was December 24th on Hollis Ave after dark<br>
                        When I seen a man chilling with his dog in the park<br>
                        I approached him very slowly with my heart full of fear<br>
                        Looked at his dog, oh my God, an ill reindeer<br>
                        But then I was illin' because the man had a beard<br>
                        And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared<br>
                        So I turned my head a second and the man was gone<br>
                        But he left his driver's wallet smack dead on the lawn<br>
                        I picked the wallet up but then I took a pause<br>
                        Took out the license and it cold said "Santa Claus"<br>
                        A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's<br>
                        Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease<br>
                        But I'd never steal from Santa, cause that ain't right<br>
                        So I'm going home to mail it back to him that night<br>
                        But when I got home I bugged, cause under the tree<br>
                        Was a letter from Santa and the dough was for me<br>
                        <br>
                        [D.M.C.]<br>
                        It's Christmas time in Hollis, Queens<br>
                        Mom's cooking chicken and collard greens<br>
                        Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese<br>
                        And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees<br>
                        Decorate the house with lights at night<br>
                        Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright<br>
                        In the fireplace is the yule log<br>
                        Beneath the mistletoe as we drink eggnog<br>
                        The rhymes you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's<br>
                        But each and every year we bust Christmas carols<br>
                        (Christmas melodies)<br>
                        <br>
                        [Run-D.M.C.]<br>
                        Rhymes so loud and proud you hear it<br>
                        It's Christmas time and we got the spirit<br>
                        Jack Frost chillin', the hawk is out<br>
                        And that's what Christmas is all about<br>
                        The time is now, the place is here<br>
                        And the whole wide world is filled with cheer<br>
                        <br>
                        [D.M.C.]<br>
                        My name's D.M.C. with the mic in my hand<br>
                        And I'm chilling and coolin' just like a snowman<br>
                        So open your eyes, lend us an ear<br>
                        We want to say<br>

                      Jingle Bells is one of the best-known and commonly sung American songs in the world. It was
                      written by James Lord Pierpont (1822–1893) and published under the title "One Horse Open Sleigh"
                      in the autumn of 1857. It has been claimed that it was originally written to be sung by a Sunday
                      school choir; however, historians dispute this, stating that it was much too "racy" (and secular)
                      to be sung by a children's church choir in the days it was written.

                          "Baby, It's Cold Outside" is an Academy Award-winning popular song written by Frank Loesser in
                          1944, which gained wide recognition in 1949 when it was performed in the film Neptune's
                          Daughter.<br>
                          While the lyrics make no mention of any holiday, it is popularly regarded as a Christmas song
                          owing to its winter theme.<br>
                          The song was released in no fewer than 8 recordings in 1949 and has been covered numerous
                          times since.

                          I really can't stay (Baby it's cold outside)<br>
                          I gotta go away (Baby it's cold outside)<br>
                          This evening has been (Been hoping that you'd dropped in)<br>
                          So very nice (I'll hold your hands they're just like ice)<br>
                          My mother will start to worry (Beautiful what's your hurry?)<br>
                          My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to the fireplace roar)<br>
                          So really I'd better scurry (Beautiful please don't hurry)<br>
                          Well maybe just a half a drink more (I'll put some records on while I pour)<br <br>
                          The neighbors might think (Baby it's bad out there)<br>
                          Say what's in this drink? (No cabs to be had out there)<br>
                          I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight now)<br>
                          To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell) (Why thank you)<br>
                          I ought to say no, no, no sir (Mind if move in closer?)<br>
                          At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the sense of hurtin' my pride?)<br>
                          I really can't stay (Baby don't hold out)<br>
                          Baby it's cold outside<br>
                          <br>
                          Ah, you're very pushy you know?<br>
                          I like to think of it as opportunistic<br>
                          <br>
                          I simply must go (Baby it's cold outside)<br>

                          The welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped in)<br>
                          So nice and warm (Look out the window at that storm)<br>
                          My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips look delicious!)<br>
                          My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon a tropical shore)<br>
                          My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips are delicious!)<br>
                          Well maybe just a cigarette more (Never such a blizzard before) (And I don't even smoke)<br>
                          <br>
                          I've got to get home (Baby you'll freeze out there)<br>
                          Say lend me a coat? (It's up to your knees out there!)<br>
                          You've really been grand, (I feel when I touch your hand)<br>
                          But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to me?)<br>
                          There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my life long sorrow!)<br>
                          At least there will be plenty implied (If you caught pneumonia and died!)<br>
                          I really can't stay (Get over that old out)<br>
                          Baby it's cold<br>
                          Baby it's cold outside<br>
                          Okay fine, just another drink then<br>
                          That took a lot of convincing!<br>

                          "Carol of the Bells" is a popular Christmas carol, with music by Ukrainian composer Mykola
                          Leontovych in 1914 and lyrics by Peter J. Wilhousky. The song is based on the Ukrainian folk
                          chant
                          "Shchedryk". Pentatonix (abbreviated PTX) is an American a cappella group famous for their

                          José
                          Feliciano. With its simple Spanish chorus (the traditional Christmas/ New Year greeting,

                          Navidad, próspero año y felicidad" meaning "Merry Christmas, a prosperous year and happiness")

                          "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" was released in 1971 as a single by John & Yoko/Plastic Ono Band
                          with the Harlem Community Choir. The lyrics are set to the traditional English ballad
                          "Skewball". The song reached number four in the UK, where its release was delayed until
                          November 1972, and has periodically reemerged on the UK Singles Chart, most notably after
                          Lennon's death in December 1980, when it peaked at number two. In a UK-wide poll in December
                          2012, it was voted tenth on the ITV television special The Nation's Favourite Christmas Song.

                      [Chorus]<br>
                      Think of all the fun I've missed<br>
                      Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed<br>
                      Next year I could be just as good<br>
                      If you'll check off my Christmas list<br>

                      And checks<br>

                      Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing<br>
                      A ring<br>
                      I don't mean on the phone<br>
                      Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight<br>
                      Hurry down the chimney tonight<br>
                      Hurry, tonight<br>

                          Also a protest song against the Vietnam War, "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" has since become a
                          Christmas standard, frequently covered by other artists, appearing on compilation albums of
                          seasonal music, and named in polls as a holiday favourite.

                      "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" is a song written by Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane
                      and introduced by Judy Garland in the 1944 MGM musical Meet Me in St. Louis. Frank Sinatra
                      later recorded a version with modified lyrics. In 2007, ASCAP ranked it the third most
                      performed Christmas song during the preceding five years that had been written by ASCAP
                      members. In 2004 it finished at No. 76 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Songs rankings of the
                      top tunes in American cinema.

                          "Jingle Bell Rock" is an American popular Christmas song first released by Bobby Helms in 1957
                          (after it was recorded in October of that year). It has received frequent airplay in the
                          United
                          States
                          during every Christmas season since then. "Jingle Bell Rock" was composed by Joseph Carleton
                          Beal
                          (1900–1967)
                          and James Ross Boothe (1917–1976). Beal was a Massachusetts-born public relations professional
                          and
                          longtime resident of South Ocean Avenue in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Boothe was an
                          American
                          writer in

                          Jingle Bells is one of the best-known and commonly sung American songs in the world. It was
                          written by James Lord Pierpont (1822–1893) and published under the title "One Horse Open
                          Sleigh"
                          in the autumn of 1857. It has been claimed that it was originally written to be sung by a
                          Sunday
                          school choir; however, historians dispute this, stating that it was much too "racy" (and
                          secular)
                          to be sung by a children's church choir in the days it was written.

                          I went out on the snow<br>

                          A gent was riding by<br>

                      That's the jingle bell rock<br>
                      <br>
                      Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock<br>
                      Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time<br>
                      Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square<br>
                      In the frosty air<br>
                      <br>
                      What a bright time, it's the right time<br>
                      To rock the night away<br>
                      Jingle bell time is a swell time<br>
                      To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh<br>
                      <br>
                      Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet<br>
                      Jingle around the clock<br>
                      Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet<br>
                      That's the jingle bell<br>
                      That's the jingle bell<br>
                      That's the jingle bell rock<br>

                          Last Christmas, I gave you my heart<br>
                          But the very next day you gave it away<br>
                          This year, to save me from tears<br>
                          I'll give it to someone special<br>

                          [Verse 1]<br>
                          Once bitten and twice shy<br>
                          I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye<br>
                          Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?<br>
                          Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me<br>
                          <br>
                          [Verse 2]<br>
                          (Happy Christmas) I wrapped it up and sent it<br>
                          With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it<br>
                          Now I know what a fool I've been<br>
                          But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again<br>
                          <br>

                          [Verse 3]<br>
                          A crowded room, friends with tired eyes<br>
                          I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice<br>
                          My God, I thought you were someone to rely on<br>
                          Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on<br>
                          <br>
                          [Verse 4]<br>
                          A face on a lover with a fire in his heart<br>
                          A man under cover but you tore me apart<br>
                          Ooh-hoo<br>
                          Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again<br>

                          Rockin' around the Christmas tree<br>
                          At the Christmas party hop<br>
                          Mistletoe hung where you can see<br>
                          Every couple tries to stop<br>
                          Rockin' around the Christmas tree<br>
                          Let the Christmas spirit ring<br>
                          Later we'll have some pumpkin pie<br>
                          And we'll do some caroling<br>
                          <br>
                          You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear<br>
                          Voices singing, let's be jolly<br>
                          Deck the halls with boughs of holly<br>
                          Rockin' around the Christmas tree<br>
                          Have a happy holiday<br>
                          Everyone dancin' merrily<br>
                          In the new old-fashioned way<br>

                    <p>
                      You know Dasher and Dancer<br>
                      And Prancer and Vixen<br>
                      Comet and Cupid<br>
                      And Donner and Blitzen<br>
                      But do you recall<br>
                      The most famous reindeer of all?<br>
                      <br>
                      Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer<br>
                      (reindeer)<br>
                      Had a very shiny nose<br>
                      (like a light bulb)<br>
                      And if you ever saw it<br>
                      (saw it)<br>
                      You would even say it glows<br>
                      (like a flash light)<br>
                      All of the other reindeer<br>
                      (reindeer)<br>
                      Used to laugh and call him names<br>
                      (like Pinocchio)<br>
                      They never let poor Rudolph<br>
                      (Rudolph)<br>
                      Play in any reindeer games<br>
                      (like Monopoly)<br>
                      <br>
                      Then one foggy Christmas Eve<br>
                      Santa came to say<br>
                      (Ho Ho Ho)<br>
                      Rudolph with your nose so bright<br>
                      Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?<br>
                      Then all the reindeer loved him<br>
                      (loved him)<br>
                      And they shouted out with glee<br>
                      (yippee)<br>
                      "Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer<br>
                      (reindeer)<br>
                      You'll go down in history!"<br>

                          "Run, Rudolph, Run" is a Christmas song popularized by Chuck Berry, written by Johnny Marks
                          and Marvin Brodie and published by St. Nicholas Music (ASCAP). The song was first recorded
                          by Berry in 1958 and released as a single on Chess Records. It has since been covered by
                          numerous
                          other artists, sometimes with the title "Run, Run, Rudolph". The song is a 12-bar blues,
                          musically
                          similar to Berry's very popular and recognizable song "Johnny B. Goode" and melodically
                          identical
                          to
                          his song "Little Queenie", released in 1959.

                        <p>
                          Out of all the reindeers, you know you're the mastermind<br>
                          Run, run Rudolph, Randalph ain't too far behind<br>
                          Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town<br>
                          Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down<br>
                          Run, run Rudolph cause I'm reeling like a merry-go-round<br>
                          <br>
                          Said Santa to a boy "Child, what have you been longing for?"<br>
                          "All I want for Christmas is a Rock and Roll electric guitar"<br>
                          And then away went Rudolph whizzing like a shooting star<br>
                          <br>
                          Run, run Rudolph, Santa has to make it to town<br>
                          Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down<br>
                          Run, run Rudolph, reeling like a merry-go-round<br>
                          <br>
                          Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town<br>
                          Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down<br>
                          Run, run Rudolph, I'm reeling like a merry-go-round<br>
                          <br>
                          Said Santa to a girl "Child, what would please you most to get?"<br>
                          "A little baby doll that can cry, sleep, drink and wet"<br>
                          And then away went Rudolph, whizzing like a Saber jet<br>
                          <br>
                          Run, run Rudolph, Santa's got to make it to town<br>
                          Santa make him hurry, tell him he can take the freeway down<br>
                          Run, run Rudolph, I'm reeling like a merry-go-round<br>

                          Santa Baby is a 1953 Christmas song written by Joan Javits (the niece of Senator Jacob K.
                          Javits)
                          and Philip Springer, sung originally by Eartha Kitt. The song is a tongue-in-cheek look at a
                          Christmas list addressed to Santa Claus by a woman who wants extravagant gifts such as sables,
                          yachts, and decorations from Tiffany's.

                    <p>
                      Rockin' around the Christmas tree<br>
                      At the Christmas party hop<br>
                      Mistletoe hung where you can see<br>
                      Every couple tries to stop<br>
                      Rockin' around the Christmas tree<br>
                      Let the Christmas spirit ring<br>
                      Later we'll have some pumpkin pie<br>
                      And we'll do some caroling<br>
                      <br>
                      You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear<br>
                      Voices singing, let's be jolly<br>
                      Deck the halls with boughs of holly<br>
                      Rockin' around the Christmas tree<br>
                      Have a happy holiday<br>
                      Everyone dancin' merrily<br>
                      In the new old-fashioned way<br>
                      <br>
                      You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear<br>

                          setting.
                          The version sung by Bing Crosby is the world's best-selling single with estimated sales in
                          excess
                          of 50 million copies worldwide. When the figures for other versions of the song are added to
                          Crosby's, sales of the song exceed 100 million.
