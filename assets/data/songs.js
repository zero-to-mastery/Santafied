        Last Christmas, I gave you my heart

        <br>
        Once bitten and twice shy
        I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
        Tell me, baby, do you recognize me?
        Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
        <br>
        <br>
        [Verse 2]
        <br>
        (Happy Christmas) I wrapped it up and sent it
        With a note saying, "I love you", I meant it

        I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice

    title: `Jingle Bells Rock`,
    description: `Jingle Bells is one of the best-known and commonly sung American songs in the world.
        It was written by James Lord Pierpont (1822–1893) and published under the title "One Horse Open Sleigh" in the autumn of 1857.
        It has been claimed that it was originally written to be sung by a Sunday school choir; however, historians dispute this,
        stating that it was much too "racy" (and secular) to be sung by a children's church choir in the days it was written.`,

        It was December 24th on Hollis Ave after dark
        When I seen a man chilling with his dog in the park
        I approached him very slowly with my heart full of fear
        Looked at his dog, oh my God, an ill reindeer
        But then I was illin' because the man had a beard
        And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared
        So I turned my head a second and the man was gone
        But he left his driver's wallet smack dead on the lawn
        I picked the wallet up but then I took a pause
        Took out the license and it cold said "Santa Claus"
        A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's
        Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease
        But I'd never steal from Santa, cause that ain't right
        So I'm going home to mail it back to him that night
        But when I got home I bugged, cause under the tree
        Was a letter from Santa and the dough was for me

        Mom's cooking chicken and collard greens
        Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese
        And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees
        Decorate the house with lights at night
        Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright
        In the fireplace is the yule log
        Beneath the mistletoe as we drink eggnog
        The rhymes you hear are the rhymes of Darryl's
        But each and every year we bust Christmas carols

        Jack Frost chillin', the hawk is out
        And that's what Christmas is all about

    description: `"Feliz Navidad" is a Christmas song written in 1970 by the Puerto Rican
        singer and songwriter José Feliciano. With its simple Spanish chorus
        (the traditional Christmas/ New Year greeting, "Feliz Navidad, próspero año y felicidad" meaning
        "Merry Christmas, a prosperous year and happiness") and equally simple English verse
        "I wanna wish you a Merry Christmas from the bottom of my heart", it has become a classic Christmas pop song.`,

    title: `Happy Xmas (War is Over)`,
    description: `"Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" was released in 1971 as a single by John & Yoko/Plastic Ono Band with the Harlem Community Choir.
        The lyrics are set to the traditional English ballad "Skewball". The song reached number four in the UK, where its release was delayed until November 1972,
        and has periodically reemerged on the UK Singles Chart, most notably after Lennon's death in December 1980, when it peaked at number two.
        In a UK-wide poll in December 2012, it was voted tenth on the ITV television special The Nation's Favourite Christmas Song.

        Also a protest song against the Vietnam War, "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)" has since become a Christmas standard, frequently covered by other artists,
        appearing on compilation albums of seasonal music, and named in polls as a holiday favourite.`,

    lyrics: `[Verse 1]<br>
        Santa baby, just slip a sable under the tree<br>
        For me<br>
        Been an awful good girl<br>
        Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 2]<br>
        Santa baby, a 54 convertible too<br>
        Light blue<br>
        I'll wait up for you dear<br>
        Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight<br>

        Think of all the fun I've missed<br>
        Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed<br>
        Next year I could be just as good<br>
        If you'll check off my Christmas list<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 3]<br>
        Santa baby, I wanna yacht<br>
        And really that's not a lot<br>
        Been an angel all year<br>
        Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 4]<br>
        Santa honey, one little thing I really need<br>
        The deed<br>
        To a platinum mine<br>
        Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight<br>
        <br>
        [Verse 5]<br>
        Santa cutie, and fill my stocking with a duplex<br>
        And checks<br>
        Sign your 'X' on the line<br>
        Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight<br>
        <br>
        [Bridge]<br>
        Come and trim my Christmas tree<br>
        With some decorations bought at Tiffany's<br>
        I really do believe in you<br>
        Let's see if you believe in me<br>
        <br>
        [Outro]<br>
        Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing<br>
        A ring<br>
        I don't mean on the phone<br>
        Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight<br>
        Hurry down the chimney tonight<br>
        Hurry, tonight<br>`

        I gotta go away (Baby it's cold outside)<br>

        dropped in)<br>
        So very nice (I'll hold your hands they're just
        like
        ice)<br>
        My mother will start to worry (Beautiful what's
        your

        My father will be pacing the floor (Listen to
        the
        fireplace roar)<br>
        So really I'd better scurry (Beautiful please
        don't
        hurry)<br>

        some

        there)<br>
        Say what's in this drink? (No cabs to be had out
        there)<br>
        I wish I knew how (Your eyes are like starlight
        now)<br>
        To break this spell (I'll take your hat, your

        I ought to say no, no, no sir (Mind if move in

        At least I'm gonna say that I tried (What's the

        I like to think of it as opportunistic<br>

        I simply must go (Baby it's cold outside)<br>
        The answer is no (But baby it's cold
        outside)<br>
        The welcome has been (How lucky that you dropped
        in)<br>
        So nice and warm (Look out the window at that
        storm)<br>
        My sister will be suspicious (Gosh your lips

        delicious!)<br>
        My brother will be there at the door (Waves upon
        a
        tropical shore)<br>
        My maiden aunt's mind is vicious (Gosh your lips
        are
        delicious!)<br>

        blizzard before) (And I don't even smoke)<br>
        <br>
        I've got to get home (Baby you'll freeze out
        there)<br>
        Say lend me a coat? (It's up to your knees out
        there!)<br>
        You've really been grand, (I feel when I touch
        your
        hand)<br>
        But don't you see? (How can you do this thing to
        me?)<br>
        There's bound to be talk tomorrow (Think of my
        life
        long sorrow!)<br>
        At least there will be plenty implied (If you
        caught
        pneumonia and died!)<br>
        I really can't stay (Get over that old out)<br>
        Baby it's cold<br>
        Baby it's cold outside<br>
        Okay fine, just another drink then<br>
        That took a lot of convincing!<br>`

Another holiday alone to celebrate

You're all I need
Underneath the tree
