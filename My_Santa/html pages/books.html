        <p>Fay and Danny are madly in love and it's all Fay's ever dreamed of. But she left everything - including the
          delightful cake shop she used to run - to be with Danny on his cosy canal boat The Dreamcatcher. And as she

          friends and the Cake Shop in the Garden. Even as Fay happily returns to dry land and her passion for baking,
          she knows it will be hard being away from Danny, especially with Christmas round the corner. But their
